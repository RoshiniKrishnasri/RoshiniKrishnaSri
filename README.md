## ✨ About Me

Hi! I'm *Roshini*, a passionate and curious learner from Bangalore, India 🇮🇳.  
I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech in Data Science, on an exciting journey to become a skilled data professional.  

I truly believe that *learning never stops*, and I’m motivated every day to grow, explore, and contribute to the tech community.

What keeps me going? It’s the joy of solving problems, the thrill of creating something from scratch, and the satisfaction of helping others learn and grow along with me.  
I love sharing what I learn — whether it’s a small Python trick, an interesting dataset, or an open-source contribution.

📚 *My Mantra:* Learn → Apply → Share → Connect

## 🚀 My Motivation

From my first “Hello World” in Python to building data pipelines and visualizations, I’ve seen how powerful technology can be in solving real-world problems.  
I want to contribute to meaningful projects that make an impact — big or small.

I’m a firm believer in the power of *community* and *collaboration*.  
Connecting with like-minded people, sharing ideas, and building cool things together is what excites me the most!
